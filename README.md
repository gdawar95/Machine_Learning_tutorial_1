# Machine_Learning_tutorial_1
 we will be using the popular machine learning library scikit-learn in tandem with a popular scientific computing library in Python, NumPy, to investigate basic machine learning principles and models.
 
The topics that will be covered in this lab include:

1. Introduction to scikit-learn and NumPy
2. Data preparation and cleaning with Pandas
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Nearest neighbors classification algorithm

Note: Some other useful Python libraries include matplotlib (for plotting/graphing) and Pandas (for data analysis), though we won't be going into detail on these in this bootcamp.

Jupyter Notebooks
This lab will be using Jupyter Notebooks as a Python development environment. Hopefully you're somewhat familiar with them. Write your code in cells (this is a cell!) and execute your code by pressing the play button (up top) or by entering ctrl+enter. To format a cell for text, you can select "Markdown" from the dropdown - the default formatting is "Code", which will usually be what you want.
